Customer Report
=====================================================================

Purpose:
- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
   - total orders
   - total sales
   - total quantity purchased
   - total products
   - lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
   - recency (months since last order)
   - average order value
   - average monthly spend
